# 2-bit-Counter-for-branch-prediction

The aim of this project is to create a 2-bit saturating up-down counter (referred to as Automaton A2 in the paper) and another variation, Automaton A3. Additionally, the project involves evaluating and contrasting the performance of these two distinct states in a two-level branch prediction system. This initiative also serves to acquaint individuals with zsim, a Pin-based x86-64 simulator that models an out-of-order issue processor with a comprehensive memory hierarchy designed for large-scale multicore architectures.
